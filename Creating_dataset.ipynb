      "\"An Alabama mother who was killed by her boyfriend in a murder suicide was shielded by her 10 year old son, who was seriously injured in the Sunday evening shooting, police said. Police in Sheffield, Ala., identified the fatal victim as 38 year old Ashley Lynn McClung and her boyfriend as 40 year old Christopher Narmore, who subsequently died by suicide, Chief Ricky Terry of the Sheffield Police Department confirms to PEOPLE. (A GoFundMe and a memorial set in her name, shared by McClung's loved ones on social media, identify her as Ashley Lynn Newton and Ashley Lynn Newton McClung, respectively.) Her son, who WAFF identified as 10 year old Cayson McClung citing a public statement by his school principal, was shot in the face and arm as he tried to protect her, according to Terry. Ashley and Narmore were in an argument that “escalated” on Sunday evening, Terry tells PEOPLE. “The boyfriend had a gun and tried to shoot the mother and [Cayson] got into a tussle with the boyfriend,” he says. “He raised his arm up and that is when the boyfriend shot the juvenile, then he shot the mother, then he killed himself.” Cayson was seriously injured but conscious when medics and police arrived, the chief says, and was able to tell authorities what happened. Terry confirms to PEOPLE that the 10 year old has had two surgeries and is in stable condition. “Doctors were able to save his arm,” he says. “They got a lot of the lead out of his face from the shotgun injury.”\n"
